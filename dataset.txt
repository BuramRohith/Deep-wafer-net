Center	Defects concentrated in the center of the wafer.
Donut	Defects form a ring-like pattern around the center.
Edge Local	Defects appear near the wafer's edge in small clusters.
Edge Ring	Defects form a continuous ring along the wafer's edge.
Local	Defects are randomly distributed in small, localized regions.
Scratch	Linear or curved scratches appear on the wafer.
Near Full	The majority of the wafer is covered with defects.
None	No defects (Normal wafer).
Random	Defects scattered randomly across the wafer.
